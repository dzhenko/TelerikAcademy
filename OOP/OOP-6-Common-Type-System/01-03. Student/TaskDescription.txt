Define a class Student, which contains data about a student – first, middle and last name, SSN, permanent address, mobile phone e-mail, course, specialty, university, faculty. Use an enumeration for the specialties, universities and faculties. Override the standard methods, inherited by  System.Object: Equals(), ToString(), GetHashCode() and operators == and !=.
Add implementations of the ICloneable interface. The Clone() method should deeply copy all object's fields into a new object of type Student.
Implement the  IComparable<Student> interface to compare students by names (as first criteria, in lexicographic order) and by social security number (as second criteria, in increasing order).
