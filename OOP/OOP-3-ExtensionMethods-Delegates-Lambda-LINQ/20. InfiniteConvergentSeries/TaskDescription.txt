* By using delegates develop an universal static method to calculate the sum of infinite convergent series with given precision depending on a function of its term. By using proper functions for the term calculate with a 2-digit precision the sum of the infinite series:
	1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + …
	1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + 1/5! + …
	1 + 1/2 - 1/4 + 1/8 - 1/16 + …
