Write a program to calculate the "Minimum Edit Distance" (MED) between two words. MED(x, y) is the minimal sum of costs of edit operations used to transform x to y. Sample costs are given below:

cost (replace a letter) = 1
cost (delete a letter) = 0.9
cost (insert a letter) = 0.8

Example: x = "developer", y = "enveloped"  cost = 2.7 

delete ‘d’:  "developer"  "eveloper", cost = 0.9
insert ‘n’:  "eveloper"  "enveloper", cost = 0.8
replace ‘r’  ‘d’:  "enveloper"  "enveloped", cost = 1
