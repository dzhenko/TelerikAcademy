You are given a tree of N nodes represented as a set of N-1 pairs of nodes (parent node, child node), each in the range (0..N-1). Example:
7
2 4
3 2
5 0
3 5
5 6
5 1

Write a program to read the tree and find:

the root node
all leaf nodes
all middle nodes
the longest path in the tree
* all paths in the tree with given sum S of their nodes
* all subtrees with given sum S of their nodes
