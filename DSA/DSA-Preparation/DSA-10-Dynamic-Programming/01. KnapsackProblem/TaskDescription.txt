Write a program based on dynamic programming to solve the "Knapsack Problem": you are given N products, each has weight Wi and costs Ci and a knapsack of capacity M and you want to put inside a subset of the products with highest cost and weight ≤ M. The numbers N, M, Wi and Ci are integers in the range [1..500]. Example: M=10 kg, N=6, products:
beer – weight=3, cost=2
vodka – weight=8, cost=12
cheese – weight=4, cost=5
nuts – weight=1, cost=4
ham – weight=2, cost=3
whiskey – weight=8, cost=13

Optimal solution:
nuts + whiskey
weight = 9
cost = 17
